## Description

The goal of the Coviders is to combat challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic through Software. We will help build teams, recognize current needs, ideate and prototype software solutions, and productionize projects to maximize the impact these teams can have. We host a number of different workshops kicked off by a hackathon.

We also want to document our proccess for doing this to easily allow others to host their own set of hackathons/events that are specific to their locale, similar to the Nepali Coviders Hackathon.

* 15 May 2020: Nepali Coviders Hackathon
* 29 May 2020: Global Coviders Hackathon
